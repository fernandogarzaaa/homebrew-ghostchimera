# Homebrew formula for Ghost Chimera (tap distribution).
#
# Upstream Homebrew core admission is out of scope; ship via a tap:
#   brew tap fernandogarzaaa/ghostchimera
#   brew install ghostchimera
# See homebrew/README.tap.md for the 5-minute tap setup.
#
# Maintainer release checklist:
#   1. Tag vX.Y.Z on GitHub, note the tarball SHA256 below.
#   2. python -m build && twine upload dist/*
#   3. `brew audit --new ghostchimera` and `brew test ghostchimera` before tap push.
